Artikel: National differences in dissemination and use of open access literature — Simard, Ghiasi, Mongeon, Larivière (2022). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272730.

Kutipan singkat

1. Abstract : Open Access (OA) dissemination has been gaining a lot of momentum over the last decade, thanks to the implementation of several OA policies by funders and institutions, as well as the development of several new platforms that facilitate the publication of OA content at low or no cost. Studies have shown that nearly half of the contemporary scientific literature could be available online for free. We find that, on average, low-income countries are publishing and citing OA at the highest rate, while upper middle-income countries and higher-income countries publish and cite OA articles at below world-average rates. These results highlight national differences in OA uptake and suggest that more OA initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are needed to support wider adoption of open scholarship.

2. Introduction : Open Access (OA) dissemination makes research outputs freely available on the public Internet, allowing users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full text without financial, legal, or technical barriers, in accordance with an open copyright licence [1]. A major milestone in OA awareness was the 2001 Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), which clearly distinguished between two main types of OA: self-archiving (green OA) and journals that distribute scholarly material freely on the publisher’s website (gold OA). While gold OA journals may charge article processing fees to cover publication costs, the origins of OA trace back to the 1970s when computer scientists shared their work via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers. The first OA journals appeared in the late 1980s, including New Horizons in Adult Education, Psycholoquy (1989), and Public-Access Computer Systems Review (1989). In the early 1990s, the movement accelerated with the creation of numerous electronic journals and notably the launch of arXiv (1991) by Paul Ginsparg, enabling researchers to deposit preprints freely online. That same year, Dr. Allen Bromley, advisor to President George H. W. Bush, issued policy statements advocating global open access, open data, and preservation in open repositories [2]. In 2000, BioMed Central became the first for-profit OA publisher. Nearly half a century after the first use of FTP servers for sharing papers, OA continues to gain momentum, driven by policies from funders and universities and by evolving business models from both for-profit and non-profit publishers. Studies estimate that nearly half of research articles are freely accessible online [3–5], and prior research has explored OA availability [3–5], citation advantages [4, 6, 7], and mandate compliance [8]. While OA is often argued to enhance global participation in science, particularly for developing countries, few studies [9, 10] have compared how nations—especially developing ones—use OA literature. This paper provides a contemporary overview of global OA adoption, distinguishing between publishing in OA, citing OA works, and the two main OA types (green and gold).

3. Conclusion : Our study provides a snapshot of the state of open access (OA) between 2015 and 2019, revealing that while a significant portion of scientific output was available in OA, concerns remain about the preservation of OA literature and the integrity of scholarly communication. By combining bibliographic indexes such as Scopus, Ulrichsweb, and the Directory of Open Access Journals, researchers traced journals through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and found that 174 OA journals had disappeared from the web between 2000 and 2019—a number likely underestimated due to data limitations. These vanished journals often shared traits, such as affiliations with academic institutions or scholarly societies in North America, and commonly published research in the social sciences and humanities. This finding underscores the need for collaborative efforts to ensure long-term access and prevent further loss of scholarly knowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the importance of OA in enabling rapid and efficient dissemination of scientific information. Major publishers such as Springer-Nature, AAAS (Science), Elsevier, and the Massachusetts Medical Society (NEJM) temporarily made COVID-19-related papers freely available, though the permanence of this access remains uncertain. Despite geopolitical tensions and national publication directives, many countries increased their international collaborations and OA outputs during the pandemic, with the severity of COVID-19 being the primary factor influencing OA publication rates rather than prior OA practices. Interestingly, high-GDP countries tended to engage less in OA and international collaboration, possibly due to their self-sufficiency in research funding and capacity. Conversely, the pandemic may have provided middle-income countries with new opportunities to bridge the OA divide by fostering greater participation in global scientific exchange. Ultimately, this global crisis underscores the urgent need for sustainable OA dissemination systems, as continued dependence on private, for-profit publishers means that true openness will rely on either publishers’ goodwill or the research community’s collective ability and commitment to support it.

Abstract : Open Access (OA) dissemination has been gaining a lot of momentum over the last decade,

"""Kedua grafik dan tabel tersebut menggambarkan struktur fonetis kata dari teks artikel ilmiah tentang Open Access berdasarkan jumlah vokal (a, e, i, o, u) dan konsonan di setiap kata.

Tujuannya adalah untuk mengetahui seberapa sering kombinasi panjang vokal–konsonan muncul dalam teks akademik, serta variasi kata uniknya.

A. Heatmap Pertama : Frekuensi Total Kata

Heatmap pertama memperlihatkan berapa banyak total kata (termasuk pengulangan) yang memiliki kombinasi tertentu dari jumlah vokal dan konsonan.

1. Pola yang Terlihat:

    Pusat kepadatan warna biru gelap berada di area:

    - vokal = 1–2

    - konsonan = 2–4

    -Nilai tertinggi:

    - vokal=1, konsonan=2 → 100 kata

    - vokal=1, konsonan=1 → 83 kata

    - vokal=2, konsonan=4 → 57 kata

2. Interpretasi:

    Sebagian besar kata memiliki 3–6 huruf, dengan kombinasi umum seperti:

    - 1 vokal + 2–3 konsonan (contoh: and, for, not, has)

    - 2 vokal + 3–4 konsonan (contoh: open, paper, global)

    - Kata pendek (1 vokal, 1–2 konsonan) sering muncul karena artikel ilmiah mengandung banyak kata penghubung (in, on, as, at, of, to).

    - Kata menengah (2–3 vokal, 3–5 konsonan) mendominasi bagian utama teks ilmiah — istilah konseptual seperti access, online, policy, data, system.

3. Distribusi keseluruhan:

    Semakin panjang kata (lebih dari 6 konsonan atau 5 vokal), frekuensinya menurun tajam.

    Ini menggambarkan proporsi alami bahasa Inggris ilmiah yang efisien: banyak kata sedang, sedikit kata panjang.

B. Heatmap Kedua : Jumlah Kata Unik
    
Heatmap kedua ini menghitung kata berbeda saja (tanpa menghitung pengulangan).

1. Pola Warna:

    Pusat warna hijau gelap juga di sekitar:

    - vokal = 2–3

    - konsonan = 3–5

    Nilai tertinggi:

    - vokal=2, konsonan=3 → 31 kata unik

    - vokal=1, konsonan=3 → 21 kata unik

    - vokal=3, konsonan=5 → 29 kata unik

2. Interpretasi:

    Kata dengan panjang sedang (sekitar 5–8 huruf) memiliki variasi bentuk tertinggi.

    Kata yang lebih panjang (lebih dari 6 konsonan dan 5 vokal) jauh lebih sedikit, namun biasanya bersifat konseptual dan spesifik, misalnya international, collaboration, publication.

    Artinya: Teks ilmiah cenderung menggunakan banyak kata umum dan sedang untuk efisiensi, sementara kata panjang digunakan secara selektif untuk istilah penting.

C. Analisi linguistikk dan struktural

| Aspek                         | Temuan                                                                            |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Dominasi kata**             | Kata dengan 1–3 vokal dan 2–5 konsonan mendominasi (>70% teks).                   |
| **Kata pendek (1 vokal)**     | Umumnya kata fungsi seperti *to, in, on, of, by, as*.                             |
| **Kata menengah (2–3 vokal)** | Kata utama seperti *access, paper, global, online, journal*.                      |
| **Kata panjang (4–6 vokal)**  | Istilah teknis seperti *international, collaboration, publication*.               |
| **Rasio vokal:konsonan**      | Sekitar **1 : 2**, menunjukkan struktur kata khas bahasa Inggris formal.          |
| **Sebaran diagonal**          | Menunjukkan bahwa panjang kata meningkat seiring bertambahnya vokal dan konsonan. |

"""Gambar menampilkan distribusi jumlah kata per kalimat dalam artikel ilmiah bertema Open Access (OA).
Statistik di bawah grafik menjelaskan ringkasan kuantitatif dari struktur kalimat dalam artikel.

A. Penjelasan Histogram

1. Sumbu X — Jumlah kata per kalimat

    Menunjukkan panjang kalimat, dihitung berdasarkan jumlah kata di setiap kalimat.
    Contohnya:

    - Kalimat dengan 4–10 kata = kalimat pendek

    - Kalimat dengan 25–40 kata = kalimat panjang

2. Sumbu Y — Frekuensi

    Menunjukkan berapa banyak kalimat yang memiliki panjang tertentu.
    Misalnya, bilah paling tinggi menunjukkan jumlah kalimat terbanyak ada di kisaran 10–15 kata per kalimat.

B. Interpretasi Pola Histogram

1. Bentuk distribusi terlihat cukup seimbang dengan sedikit kecenderungan ke arah kalimat menengah–panjang. Tidak ada puncak ekstrem yang mendominasi — namun terdapat konsentrasi kuat di kisaran 25–40 kata per kalimat, menunjukkan kecenderungan penggunaan kalimat kompleks.

2. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa artikel ilmiah tentang Open Access menggunakan campuran kalimat panjang dan menengah:

    - Kalimat pendek digunakan untuk menyampaikan definisi, temuan singkat, atau penegasan poin utama.

    - Kalimat panjang muncul ketika penulis menjelaskan latar belakang, hasil penelitian, atau konteks kebijakan OA secara mendalam.

C. Data Statistik

| Statistik                      | Nilai   | Makna                                                                                      |
| :----------------------------- | :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jumlah kalimat**             | 27      | Total kalimat yang dianalisis dari abstrak, pendahuluan, dan kesimpulan artikel OA.        |
| **Rata-rata kata per kalimat** | 29.26   | Kalimat tergolong **menengah–panjang**, sesuai karakter tulisan ilmiah formal.             |
| **Median kata per kalimat**    | 30.0    | Hampir sama dengan rata-rata → distribusi panjang kalimat relatif seimbang.                |
| **Kalimat terpanjang**         | 49 kata | Biasanya berupa kalimat kompleks yang menjelaskan hasil studi atau interpretasi global OA. |
| **Kalimat terpendek**          | 4 kata  | Kemungkinan berupa pernyataan penegasan sederhana, seperti *“OA increases accessibility.”* |



D. Analisi lingustik dan oenulisan

1. Rata-rata 29 kata per kalimat menunjukkan struktur formal, padat, dan argumentatif, khas artikel ilmiah berbahasa Inggris.

2. Kalimat pendek (4–10 kata) digunakan untuk:

   - Penegasan ide inti.

   - Transisi antarbagian.

   - Menarik perhatian pembaca sebelum penjelasan lebih panjang.

3. Kalimat panjang (30–50 kata) cenderung:

   - Memuat banyak klausa dan konektor (“which”, “while”, “although”).

   - Menjelaskan hubungan sebab-akibat atau pembanding.

4. Distribusi seimbang → gaya penulisan yang bervariasi dan dinamis, tidak monoton.

Abstract : Open Access (OA) dissemination has been gaining a lot of momentum over the last decade,
thanks to the implementation of several OA policies by funders and institutions, as well as the
development of several new platforms that facilitate the publication of OA content at low or no cost.
Studies have shown that nearly half of the contemporary scientific literature could be available
online for free. We find that, on average, low-income countries are publishing and citing OA at the
highest rate, while upper middle-income countries and higher-income countries publish and cite OA
articles at below world-average rates. These results highlight national differences in OA uptake
and suggest that more OA initiatives at the institutional, national, and international levels are
needed to support wider adoption of open scholarship.

Introduction : Open Access (OA) dissemination makes research outputs freely available on the public
Internet, allowing users to read, download, copy, distribute, print, search, or link to the full
text without financial, legal, or technical barriers, in accordance with an open copyright licence [1].
A major milestone in OA awareness was the 2001 Budapest Open Access Initiative (BOAI), which clearly
distinguished between two main types of OA: self-archiving (green OA) and journals that distribute
scholarly material freely on the publisher’s website (gold OA). While gold OA journals may charge
article processing fees to cover publication costs, the origins of OA trace back to the 1970s when
computer scientists shared their work via File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers. The first OA journals
appeared in the late 1980s, including New Horizons in Adult Education, Psycholoquy (1989), and
Public-Access Computer Systems Review (1989). In the early 1990s, the movement accelerated with the
creation of numerous electronic journals and notably the launch of arXiv (1991) by Paul Ginsparg,
enabling researchers to deposit preprints freely online. That same year, Dr. Allen Bromley, advisor
to President George H. W. Bush, issued policy statements advocating global open access, open data,
and preservation in open repositories [2]. In 2000, BioMed Central became the first for-profit OA
publisher. Nearly half a century after the first use of FTP servers for sharing papers, OA continues
to gain momentum, driven by policies from funders and universities and by evolving business models
from both for-profit and non-profit publishers. Studies estimate that nearly half of research articles
are freely accessible online [3–5], and prior research has explored OA availability [3–5], citation
advantages [4, 6, 7], and mandate compliance [8]. While OA is often argued to enhance global participation
in science, particularly for developing countries, few studies [9, 10] have compared how nations—especially
developing ones—use OA literature. This paper provides a contemporary overview of global OA adoption,
distinguishing between publishing in OA, citing OA works, and the two main OA types (green and gold).

Conclusion : Our study provides a snapshot of the state of open access (OA) between 2015 and 2019,
revealing that while a significant portion of scientific output was available in OA, concerns remain
about the preservation of OA literature and the integrity of scholarly communication. By combining
bibliographic indexes such as Scopus, Ulrichsweb, and the Directory of Open Access Journals, researchers
traced journals through the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine and found that 174 OA journals had
disappeared from the web between 2000 and 2019—a number likely underestimated due to data limitations.
These vanished journals often shared traits, such as affiliations with academic institutions or scholarly
societies in North America, and commonly published research in the social sciences and humanities.
This finding underscores the need for collaborative efforts to ensure long-term access and prevent
further loss of scholarly knowledge. The COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the importance of OA in
enabling rapid and efficient dissemination of scientific information. Major publishers such as
Springer-Nature, AAAS (Science), Elsevier, and the Massachusetts Medical Society (NEJM) temporarily made
COVID-19-related papers freely available, though the permanence of this access remains uncertain.
Despite geopolitical tensions and national publication directives, many countries increased their
international collaborations and OA outputs during the pandemic, with the severity of COVID-19 being
the primary factor influencing OA publication rates rather than prior OA practices. Interestingly,
high-GDP countries tended to engage less in OA and international collaboration, possibly due to their
self-sufficiency in research funding and capacity. Conversely, the pandemic may have provided middle-income
countries with new opportunities to bridge the OA divide by fostering greater participation in global
scientific exchange. Ultimately, this global crisis underscores the urgent need for sustainable OA
dissemination systems, as continued dependence on private, for-profit publishers means that true openness
will rely on either publishers’ goodwill or the research community’s collective ability and commitment
to support it.

"""A. Distribusi Jumlah Kalimat per Paragraf (Panel Kiri)

1. Terlihat ada 3 batang, mewakili 3 paragraf utama.

2. Masing-masing paragraf punya jumlah kalimat:

    - Paragraf 1 → 4 kalimat

    - Paragraf 2 → 13 kalimat

    - Paragraf 3 → 10 kalimat

3. Ini identik dengan pola sebelumnya (abstrak – pendahuluan – kesimpulan).

Interpretasi:

Struktur ini menunjukkan keseimbangan artikel ilmiah pendek:

1. Paragraf pembuka singkat (efisien),

2. Paragraf utama panjang (penjabaran),

3. Paragraf penutup sedang (merangkum).

Rata-rata kalimat per paragraf: 9.00, cukup ideal untuk teks akademik (8–10 kalimat adalah panjang umum paragraf ilmiah).

B. Sebaran Rata-rata Kata per Kalimat per Paragraf (Panel Tengah)

1. Ini adalah boxplot dari nilai:

    - Paragraf 1: 33 kata per kalimat (paling panjang),

    - Paragraf 2: 26 kata per kalimat,

    - Paragraf 3: 32 kata per kalimat (paling pendek).

Nilai median sekitar 30 - 31 kata per kalimat, dengan rentang dari ±26 sampai 33.

2. Makna linguistik:

    - Paragraf pembuka (abstrak) padat dan kompleks: setiap kalimat mengandung banyak informasi (rata-rata 33 kata).

    - Paragraf isi (introduction) cenderung lebih seimbang — memberi penjelasan tanpa kalimat terlalu panjang.

    - Paragraf akhir (kesimpulan) lebih sederhana dan langsung, yang lazim karena bagian ini menegaskan hasil secara ringkas.

Rata-rata keseluruhan: 30.33 kata per kalimat → tergolong academic register yang kompleks namun masih terbaca (umumnya antara 20–30 kata per kalimat untuk teks ilmiah formal).

A. Korelasi Panjang Paragraf vs Panjang Kalimat (Panel Kanan)

1. Sumbu X: jumlah kalimat per paragraf

2. Sumbu Y: rata-rata kata per kalimat

3. Garis regresi menurun → korelasi negatif lemah

Interpretasi:
Semakin panjang paragraf (lebih banyak kalimat), kalimat-kalimatnya justru cenderung lebih pendek.
Artinya, penulis menjaga keterbacaan:

1. Ketika paragraf menjadi panjang, ia menulis kalimat lebih ringkas agar pembaca tidak lelah.

2. Sebaliknya, di paragraf pendek (misalnya abstrak), kalimatnya lebih panjang karena tiap kalimat harus menampung ide lengkap.

Ini menunjukkan keterampilan retoris yang baik: penulis mampu menyeimbangkan panjang paragraf dan kompleksitas kalimat agar teks tetap koheren dan mudah diikuti.
