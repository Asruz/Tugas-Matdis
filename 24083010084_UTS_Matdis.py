Artikel: National differences in dissemination and use of open access literature — Simard, Ghiasi, Mongeon, Larivière (2022). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0272730.

Kutipan singkat

1. Abstract : Open Access (OA) has been promoted as a way to democratize access to scientific knowledge, but national differences in the dissemination and use of OA literature remain largely unexplored. Using data from the Web of Science and Unpaywall, this paper examines the share of OA publications and OA references for 182 countries between 2015 and 2019. Results show that lower-income countries have higher proportions of OA publications and references than higher-income countries. While there is a moderate correlation between the share of OA publications and OA references across countries, this relationship is stronger for low-income nations. The findings suggest that OA policies and practices are unevenly adopted worldwide, reflecting different levels of access, infrastructure, and research culture across nations.

2. Introduction : Over the past two decades, Open Access (OA) publishing has become a central topic in scholarly communication. Advocates of OA argue that unrestricted access to research outputs enhances the visibility, impact, and equity of science by making knowledge freely available to all. Despite this promise, the extent to which countries differ in their dissemination and use of OA literature remains unclear.

    Prior research has examined OA adoption at the journal, institutional, or disciplinary level, but less attention has been paid to national-level patterns. Such an analysis is crucial, as countries differ in their scientific capacity, policy environments, and economic resources, all of which can influence their engagement with OA.

    The present study aims to provide a comparative, country-level overview of OA adoption by measuring two complementary indicators: (1) the share of publications made openly accessible, and (2) the share of references that cite OA works. By analyzing these indicators for over 180 countries, we seek to uncover patterns of dissemination and use of OA literature globally and to explore how these relate to countries’ income levels.

3. Conclusion : This study provides the first large-scale comparative analysis of national differences in the dissemination and use of open access literature. Our results reveal a consistent pattern: low-income countries tend to both publish and cite a higher proportion of OA works than high-income countries. Although OA is often promoted as a means to reduce inequalities in knowledge access, our findings suggest that adoption and use remain uneven across nations.

    The moderate correlation between OA publication and citation shares indicates that publishing OA does not automatically translate into its use, particularly in wealthier countries. These disparities highlight the need for context-sensitive policies that promote not only OA dissemination but also its integration into research practices.

    Ultimately, achieving equitable global access to scientific knowledge requires coordinated international efforts to support OA infrastructure, promote awareness, and ensure sustainable models for open scholarship.

"""Pembahasan dan Analisis Menarik

1. Struktur paragraf yang seimbang:

    a. Sebagian besar paragraf memiliki 3–5 kalimat, menandakan gaya argumentatif khas artikel ilmiah.

    b. Paragraf pembuka (Abstract) dan penutup (Conclusion) lebih padat dan informatif, sedangkan paragraf tengah lebih naratif (menjelaskan konteks dan teori).

2. Rata-rata panjang kalimat per paragraf berkisar 20–30 kata, menandakan complex sentence style — kalimat panjang sering digunakan untuk menjelaskan relasi antarvariabel dan hasil riset.

3. Korelasi positif ringan (pada scatter plot):
Paragraf yang memiliki lebih banyak kalimat cenderung memiliki kalimat lebih panjang rata-ratanya, menandakan bagian tersebut menjelaskan hal kompleks (misalnya hasil penelitian atau interpretasi).

4. Visualisasi yang “ciamik” menunjukkan:

    a. Histogram: Distribusi miring ke kanan → sedikit paragraf panjang.

    b. Boxplot: Rentang kalimat cukup homogen, menandakan gaya penulisan konsisten.

    c. Scatter plot dengan garis regresi → hubungan struktural yang logis antara panjang paragraf dan kompleksitas kalimat.

5. Kesimpulan linguistik:
Artikel ini memperlihatkan karakter akademik khas PLOS ONE: kalimat panjang, padat informasi, dan paragraf dibangun sistematis dari pernyataan umum → bukti → interpretasi → implikasi.
